# Fit2Go

#### My First Full Stack Web Application

## Description
Fit2Go is a fitness application that gives users access to information about training and recovery. It includes various exercises and stretches along with helpful descriptions and images associated with them. There is a registration/log-in feature which allows returning members to pick up where they left off. The user can search for and save specific exercises/stretches, along with the ability to create, edit and delete them as well.
